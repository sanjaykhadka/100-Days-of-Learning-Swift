Welcome to the course *Learn Swift Coding*. This course mainly focuses on [swift](https://swift.org/) coding. 

This course is targeted for beginners and intermediate level students who are familiar with programming fundamentals and who have no prior professional development experience. This can also be useful to intermediate levels who are willing to sharpen their code exercise.

This is my first attempt towards a book related to swift coding. From my past experience of teaching other students and learning myself, I find that time and time again students struggle with three things the most.
* Where to start?
* What to learn to follow swift efficiently?
* How to stay focused and motivated?

And here comes the solution for you in the form of this course. But before you proceed forward what I would like you to do is give 1-2 hours daily in reading, writing and practice coding without skipping a day.
