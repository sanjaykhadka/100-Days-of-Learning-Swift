# Complex Data Types
## Arrays
Arrays are a collection of similar values. Lets say, while variable can only store a single value at a time, and there is no other way we can use a variable to store multiple values, we can use an array as a variable or a constant that can store multiple value at a time. 

```swift
let p1 = "Ram"
let p2 = "Shyam"
let p3 = "Hari"
let p4 = "Sita"

// array of strings
let persons = [p1, p2, p3, p4]

// array of numbers
let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]

print(numbers)
print(numbers)
```

```
**Output:**
[10, 20, 30, 40]
[10, 20, 30, 40]
```

In the code above, ```persons``` is an array of strings while ```numbers``` is an array of integers. 

We can also define an array explicitly
